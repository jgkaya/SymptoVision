To support the diagnosis of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), this project uses a tool developed using machine learning and artificial intelligence.  Machine learning models are used to determine the number of follicles using ultrasound images, while analyzing symptoms with natural language processing (NLP) methods.  Trained models maximize the diagnostic process with both visual and text data.  The user-friendly interface makes it easy to enter symptoms and upload the ultrasound image.  GPT-powered commentary explains the diagnostic result in medical language and provides users with advice for symptom management.
